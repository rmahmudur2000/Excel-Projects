**Project 1: Coffee Sales**

**Situation**

I have been working on a project involving the analysis of coffee sales data. The dataset comprises multiple CSV files, each containing different aspects of the sales data, such as yearly sales, customer information, order details, and product pricing.

**Task**

My task was to analyze the provided datasets to extract meaningful insights about coffee sales, customer behavior, and product performance. The goal was to identify trends, high-performing products, and key customer segments.

**Action**

Data Compilation: Gathered data from six different CSV files, each containing specific information about coffee sales, customers, and products.

Data Cleaning: Ensured data consistency by converting string types to appropriate numerical types where necessary.

Trend Analysis: Analyzed sales trends over the years and months to identify peak sales periods.

Customer Segmentation: Segmented customers based on their purchase history and loyalty card usage.

Product Performance: Evaluated the performance of different coffee types and roast types by analyzing sales and profit margins.

Geographical Insights: Assessed sales distribution across different countries to identify key markets.

**Result**

Sales Trends: Identified that sales have been increasing year over year, with notable peaks in certain months.

Top Customers: Recognized key customers contributing significantly to sales, such as Brenn Dundredge and Nealson Cuttler.

Product Insights: Found that Arabica and Robusta are the most popular coffee types, with medium roast being the preferred roast type.

Geographical Distribution: The United States emerged as the largest market, followed by Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Profit Margins: Determined that larger package sizes tend to have better profit margins, with specific products like 'A-L-2.5' showing high profitability.

These insights can help in strategic decision-making, such as targeted marketing campaigns, inventory management, and product development.



**Project 2: Bike Sales**

**Situation**
The company wanted to understand the factors influencing bike purchases among potential customers. This involved analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing demographic and lifestyle information of individuals, including their purchasing behavior.

**Task**
The task was to analyze the dataset to derive actionable insights, identify key trends, and create a summary of the data that would help in developing targeted marketing and sales strategies.

**Action**

**1.	Data Compilation:**

Created multiple sheets in the Excel file to organize and analyze the data efficiently.

bike_buyers: Compiled detailed demographic information, including marital status, gender, income, number of children, education level, occupation, home ownership, 
number of cars, commute distance, region, age, and bike purchasing status.
        
Working Sheet: Added an Age Brackets column to categorize individuals into different age groups, such as Middle Age and Old, for more detailed analysis.
        
Pivot Table: Generated pivot tables to summarize key metrics, such as average income of males and females who purchased a bike versus those who didnâ€™t.

**2.	Data Analysis:**

Income and Bike Purchases: Analyzed the pivot table to observe that males have a higher average income than females and that individuals with higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes.

Demographic Trends: Identified that middle-aged individuals form a significant portion of the dataset, with detailed insights into their purchasing behavior.

Regional Analysis: Segmented data by regions like Europe and Pacific to understand regional preferences and trends in bike purchases.

Home Ownership and Car Ownership: Examined how home ownership and the number of cars correlate with the economic status and lifestyle of potential buyers, influencing their decision to purchase bikes.

Education and Occupation: Evaluated the diversity in education levels and occupations, ranging from skilled manual workers to professionals, to understand how these factors might correlate with purchasing decisions and income levels.

**Result**

The analysis provided several key insights:

Males and individuals with higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes.

Middle-aged individuals form a significant segment of potential buyers.

Regional differences, home ownership, and car ownership provide insights into the lifestyle and economic status of buyers, influencing their purchasing behavior.

Education and occupation diversity help in understanding the potential buyer profiles.

These insights can guide targeted marketing strategies and sales efforts, helping the company to effectively reach and engage with potential bike buyers based on their demographic and lifestyle characteristics.
